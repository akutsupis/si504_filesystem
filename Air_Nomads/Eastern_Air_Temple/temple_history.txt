Eastern Air Temple

The Eastern Air Temple was one of the four air temples and was home to Air Nomad nuns and female airbenders. The temple was built into the side of a mountain range in the eastern part of the world.

Like the other air temples, the Eastern Air Temple featured impressive architecture that blended with the natural environment. The temple had multiple levels connected by bridges and courtyards, with living quarters for the nuns.

The Eastern Air Temple was where Avatar Aang was supposed to be sent for additional training before he ran away. The temple, like all others, was attacked during the Air Nomad Genocide and fell silent for a century.

After the war, there were efforts to restore and preserve the Air Temples as monuments to Air Nomad culture and history.

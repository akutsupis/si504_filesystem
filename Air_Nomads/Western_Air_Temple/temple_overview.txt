Western Air Temple

The Western Air Temple is unique among the air temples as it is built upside-down, hanging from the underside of a cliff. This architectural marvel showcases the Air Nomads' mastery of airbending and engineering.

The temple's inverted design meant that everything - buildings, courtyards, and gardens - hung from the cliff face. Airbenders could easily access it by flying, while others would need to take a difficult path down the cliff.

The Western Air Temple became a hideout for Team Avatar after the failed invasion of the Fire Nation on the Day of Black Sun. It was here that Zuko finally convinced the team to let him join and teach Aang firebending.

The temple represents the Air Nomads' different perspective on the world - literally and philosophically looking at things from a different angle.

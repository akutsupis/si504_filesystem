Northern Air Temple

The Northern Air Temple was one of the four air temples and was home to male airbenders before the Air Nomad Genocide. The temple is located in the mountains of the northern Earth Kingdom.

After the genocide, the temple was abandoned for nearly a century until refugees from the war, led by a mechanist inventor, took up residence there. They modified the temple extensively, adding mechanisms and inventions powered by hot air from natural geysers.

While Aang was initially upset by the changes to the sacred temple, he came to appreciate how the refugees had found a new home and purpose there. The mechanist's inventions, while different from Air Nomad traditions, showed the same creativity and ingenuity.

The Northern Air Temple became a symbol of adaptation and new life rising from tragedy, while still honoring the past.

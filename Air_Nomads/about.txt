The Air Nomads

The Air Nomads were one of the four nations and the smallest of them. They consisted of wandering monks who lived in four massive temples located at the four corners of the globe. The Air Nomads were known for their peaceful nature and spiritual practices.

Unlike other nations, all Air Nomads were airbenders due to their deep spiritual connection. They valued peace, freedom, and detachment from worldly concerns. The Air Nomads were vegetarians and had a deep respect for all life.

Tragically, the Air Nomads were wiped out by the Fire Nation in a genocide that began the Hundred Year War. Fire Lord Sozin launched this attack to eliminate the next Avatar, who would be born into the Air Nomads. Only Avatar Aang survived, frozen in an iceberg for 100 years.

After the war, Aang worked to preserve and revive Air Nomad culture and teachings.

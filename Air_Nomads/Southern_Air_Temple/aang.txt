Avatar Aang - The Last Airbender

Aang is the current Avatar and the last surviving airbender. At age 12, he learned he was the Avatar, but feeling overwhelmed by the responsibility, he ran away from home. During a storm, he entered the Avatar State and froze himself in an iceberg, where he remained for 100 years.

After being freed by Katara and Sokka, Aang learned that the Air Nomads had been wiped out and the world had been at war for a century. Despite this tragedy, Aang maintained his optimistic and playful nature while accepting his duty to master all four elements and defeat Fire Lord Ozai.

Aang is fun-loving, kind-hearted, and values all life. He struggles with the Avatar's duty to sometimes take life, remaining committed to his Air Nomad principles of peace. He eventually defeats Ozai without killing him by removing his firebending.

Notable quotes:
"When we hit our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change."
"It's easy to do nothing, it's hard to forgive."

Aang's companion is Appa, a flying bison, and his best friend is Momo, a winged lemur.

Monk Gyatso

Monk Gyatso was Avatar Aang's mentor, father figure, and best friend at the Southern Air Temple. He was one of the oldest and wisest of the Air Nomad monks and a member of the Council of Elders.

Unlike other monks who believed Aang should focus solely on his Avatar training, Gyatso believed that Aang should also enjoy his childhood. He played games with Aang, taught him to bake fruit pies, and encouraged his fun-loving nature.

When the Air Nomad Council decided to send Aang to the Eastern Air Temple for more rigorous training, this decision contributed to Aang running away. Gyatso wanted to protect Aang from the burden of being the Avatar at such a young age.

Gyatso died defending the Southern Air Temple from the Fire Nation attack. The fact that he was surrounded by Fire Nation soldiers when he fell suggests he put up an incredible fight, showing that the gentle monk was also a formidable airbending master.

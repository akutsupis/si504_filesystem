Southern Air Temple

The Southern Air Temple was one of the four temples of the Air Nomads and the home temple of Avatar Aang. Located in the mountains, it featured impressive architecture integrated into the natural landscape, with tall spires and courtyards.

The Southern Air Temple was exclusively for male airbenders and their flying bison companions. It was here that Aang trained under Monk Gyatso, his mentor and father figure.

When Aang returned to the temple after being frozen for 100 years, he discovered the tragic fate of his people. The temple had been attacked by the Fire Nation, and all the airbenders, including Monk Gyatso, had been killed.

Despite its tragic history, the temple remains an important spiritual site and a reminder of the Air Nomad culture. The temple's statue chamber contains statues of all past Avatars.

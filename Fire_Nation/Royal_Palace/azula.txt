Princess Azula

Princess Azula is a firebending master and prodigy, known for her ability to create blue flames and generate lightning. She is the younger sister of Zuko and daughter of Fire Lord Ozai.

Azula is highly intelligent, manipulative, and cunning. She was raised as her father's favorite and was groomed to be the perfect princess. Her exceptional firebending abilities and strategic mind made her a formidable opponent.

Despite her skills, Azula struggled with her mental health and her inability to form genuine relationships based on trust rather than fear.

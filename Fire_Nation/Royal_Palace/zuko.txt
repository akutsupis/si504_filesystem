Prince Zuko

Prince Zuko is a firebender and the current Fire Lord of the Fire Nation. Originally the primary enemy of Team Avatar, Zuko devoted three years to trying to capture the long-lost Avatar to end his banishment and regain his honor. 

After a long internal struggle, Zuko rejected his father Fire Lord Ozai and joined Avatar Aang to help end the Hundred Year War. He became a close friend and powerful ally to Team Avatar.

Notable quotes:
"That's all I've ever tried to be, the perfect prince, the son you wanted. But I'm not you, and I'm not Azula. I'm me!"
"It's time for me to look inward and start asking myself the big questions: Who are you and what do you want?"

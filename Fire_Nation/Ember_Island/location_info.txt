Ember Island

Ember Island is a small resort island located in the Fire Nation. It features a luxurious beach and is a popular vacation spot for Fire Nation nobility, including the Royal Family.

The island is home to the Ember Island Players, a theater troupe known for their dramatic and often inaccurate retellings of historical events. Their play "The Boy in the Iceberg" famously portrayed the adventures of Avatar Aang and his friends, much to Team Avatar's chagrin.

The Royal Family maintains a beach house on Ember Island, which became a temporary refuge for Team Avatar before the arrival of Sozin's Comet.

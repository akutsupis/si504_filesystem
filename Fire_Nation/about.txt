The Fire Nation

The Fire Nation is one of the world's four nations and five sovereign states. It is an absolute monarchy led by the Fire Lord and home to most firebenders. Geographically, the nation is located along the planet's equator in the western hemisphere and is composed of several islands.

Under the leadership of Fire Lord Sozin and his descendants, the Fire Nation initiated a century-long global conflict known as the Hundred Year War. The war ended with Fire Lord Zuko's ascension to the throne, ushering in an era of peace and harmony.

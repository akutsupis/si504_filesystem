A file and folder structure for a filesystem navigation demo

## Building the Filesystem

To build the complete filesystem structure with all directories and files, run the build script:

```bash
./build_filesystem.sh
```

This script will create:
- 21 directories organized into 4 main nations (Air_Nomads, Earth_Kingdom, Fire_Nation, Water_Tribes)
- 31 text files containing information about locations and characters from Avatar: The Last Airbender

The script can be run from any directory and will create the filesystem structure in the current working directory.

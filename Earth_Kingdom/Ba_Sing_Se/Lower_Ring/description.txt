The Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se

The Lower Ring is the outermost residential area of Ba Sing Se, home to the city's poorest citizens and refugees from the war. Life here is difficult, with crowded conditions and limited resources.

Despite the hardships, the people of the Lower Ring are resilient and maintain a sense of community. Small businesses, food stalls, and modest homes fill the streets.

Many refugees from Fire Nation attacks throughout the Earth Kingdom end up in the Lower Ring, hoping for safety within the walls of Ba Sing Se. However, the reality often doesn't match their expectations, as poverty and crime are common issues.

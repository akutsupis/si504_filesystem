Toph Beifong

Toph Beifong is a blind earthbending master and the inventor of metalbending. Despite her blindness, she "sees" through earthbending by sensing vibrations in the ground, making her an incredibly powerful bender.

Born to a wealthy family in the Upper Ring, Toph ran away to join Team Avatar and teach Aang earthbending. Her parents were overprotective due to her blindness, but Toph proved herself to be the greatest earthbender in the world.

Personality: Toph is tough, independent, and direct. She doesn't let her blindness define her and often uses sarcasm and humor.

Notable quotes:
"I am the greatest earthbender in the world! Don't you two dunderheads ever forget it!"
"There's the Toph I've been looking for!"

Ba Sing Se - The Impenetrable City

Ba Sing Se is the massive capital of the Earth Kingdom. Protected by enormous stone walls, it is considered the safest city in the world. The city is so large that it contains farms and rural areas within its walls.

The city is divided into rings:
- The Agrarian Zone: Farmland within the outer wall
- The Lower Ring: Home to refugees and the poor
- The Middle Ring: Where middle-class citizens live and work
- The Upper Ring: Where the wealthy and nobility reside
- The Royal Palace: Home to the Earth King

The city's culture emphasizes order and tradition, sometimes to the point of denial. During the war, the government kept the conflict secret from citizens to maintain peace within the walls.

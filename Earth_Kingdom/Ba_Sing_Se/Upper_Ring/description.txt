The Upper Ring of Ba Sing Se

The Upper Ring is the innermost ring of Ba Sing Se, reserved for the wealthiest and most important citizens of the Earth Kingdom. Here you'll find beautiful estates, manicured gardens, and high-end shops.

The Upper Ring is home to:
- Wealthy merchants and nobles
- Important government officials
- The prestigious Lake Laogai (which hides a dark secret)
- The fanciest tea shop in the city, The Jasmine Dragon

The residents of the Upper Ring often live in ignorance of the struggles faced by those in the Lower Ring, protected by their wealth and status.

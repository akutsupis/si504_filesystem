Omashu - The City of Innovation

Omashu is the second-largest city in the Earth Kingdom and is known for its ingenious mail delivery system that uses earthbending-powered chutes throughout the city.

The city is ruled by King Bumi, an eccentric but incredibly powerful earthbending master who is over 100 years old. Despite his age and seemingly crazy behavior, King Bumi is a genius strategist and one of the most powerful earthbenders alive.

Omashu was one of the last Earth Kingdom cities to fall to the Fire Nation during the war, thanks to King Bumi's leadership. The city represents Earth Kingdom ingenuity and the value of thinking outside the box.

Fun fact: King Bumi was a childhood friend of Avatar Aang!

King Bumi

King Bumi is the wild-eyed, eccentric king of Omashu and one of the most powerful earthbenders in the world. He is over 100 years old and was a childhood friend of Avatar Aang.

Despite appearing mad, Bumi is incredibly wise and uses unconventional methods to teach important lessons. He believes in the importance of thinking creatively and looking at problems from different angles.

When the Fire Nation conquered Omashu, Bumi surrendered peacefully and waited for the right moment to retake his city, which he did single-handedly during a solar eclipse.

Famous quote: "You must master the four elements and confront the Fire Lord. And when you do, I hope you will think like a mad genius!"

Kyoshi Island

Kyoshi Island is a small island in the Earth Kingdom, home to the Kyoshi Warriors - an elite group of female warriors who dress in the traditional garb of Avatar Kyoshi and fight with her trademark fans.

The island is named after Avatar Kyoshi, who lived 400 years before Aang. According to legend, Avatar Kyoshi created the island by splitting it from the mainland to protect her people.

The Kyoshi Warriors, led by Suki, are skilled fighters who use a unique blend of martial arts and chi-blocking techniques. They paint their faces in traditional makeup to honor Avatar Kyoshi.

The island remained neutral during the Hundred Year War until Team Avatar's visit brought Fire Nation attention to their shores.

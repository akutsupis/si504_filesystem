Suki - Leader of the Kyoshi Warriors

Suki is the leader of the Kyoshi Warriors and a skilled fighter. She is brave, loyal, and compassionate, embodying the spirit of Avatar Kyoshi.

Suki first met Team Avatar when they arrived on Kyoshi Island. She initially didn't trust them but eventually befriended them and even taught Sokka some of her fighting techniques after he humbly asked to learn.

She later joined Team Avatar in their fight against the Fire Nation and became Sokka's girlfriend. Suki was captured by the Fire Nation and imprisoned at the Boiling Rock before being rescued by Sokka and Zuko.

Her fighting style combines martial arts with fans as weapons, and she is one of the few non-benders to be a formidable opponent against benders.

Princess Yue

Princess Yue was the daughter of Chief Arnook of the Northern Water Tribe. She had distinctive white hair, a gift from the Moon Spirit which saved her life as an infant when she was born sickly.

Yue was engaged to Hahn, a Northern Water Tribe warrior, but developed feelings for Sokka when Team Avatar visited her tribe. Despite their mutual attraction, Yue honored her duty to her tribe and her engagement.

During the Fire Nation's siege of the Northern Water Tribe, Admiral Zhao killed the Moon Spirit, throwing the world into chaos. To save her people and restore balance, Princess Yue sacrificed herself to become the new Moon Spirit, as she had been blessed with the Moon Spirit's life force since birth.

Her sacrifice saved the world and she became one of the most revered figures in Water Tribe history. Sokka never forgot her.

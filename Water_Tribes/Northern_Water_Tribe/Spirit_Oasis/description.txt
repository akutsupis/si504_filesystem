The Spirit Oasis

The Spirit Oasis is a sacred place located at the heart of the Northern Water Tribe. It is a hidden sanctuary filled with lush vegetation despite the frozen landscape surrounding it, warmed by spiritual energy.

The oasis is home to Tui and La, the Moon and Ocean spirits, who take the form of koi fish - one black and one white, circling each other in an eternal dance representing the balance of push and pull, yin and yang.

Princess Yue was connected to the Moon Spirit from birth, as it saved her life when she was an infant. When the Fire Nation killed the Moon Spirit during their siege, Yue sacrificed herself to become the new Moon Spirit, restoring balance and saving the world.

The Spirit Oasis is a place of great spiritual power and is protected as the most sacred location in the Water Tribes.

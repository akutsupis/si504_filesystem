Northern Water Tribe

The Northern Water Tribe is located at the North Pole and is much larger and more fortified than its Southern counterpart. It maintained its strength throughout the Hundred Year War and is home to many skilled waterbenders.

The Northern Water Tribe is built into the ice and features impressive architecture including the Chief's palace and the sacred Spirit Oasis. The city is protected by a massive ice wall and was nearly impincible until the Fire Nation's siege during the reign of Chief Arnook.

Traditional gender roles were strictly enforced here, with women only permitted to learn healing while men learned combat waterbending. This changed after Katara challenged Master Pakku and proved women could be powerful fighters.

The Northern Water Tribe represents the preservation of waterbending traditions and culture.

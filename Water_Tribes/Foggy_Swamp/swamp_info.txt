Foggy Swamp

The Foggy Swamp, also known as the Foggy Swamp Tribe's home, is a massive wetland located in the Earth Kingdom. Despite being geographically in the Earth Kingdom, it is inhabited by waterbenders who are culturally part of the Water Tribes.

The swamp is a mysterious place where the normal rules of reality seem bent. Due to the water and spiritual energy in the swamp, it has unique properties - including the ability to show visions of people from the past, present, and future.

The Foggy Swamp Tribe are unique waterbenders who have developed plantbending, a specialized form of waterbending that manipulates the water within plants. They live simply, in harmony with the swamp.

The swamp teaches an important lesson: that all living things are connected, like the branches and roots of the great banyan-grove tree at the swamp's center.

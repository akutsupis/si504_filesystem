Sokka - Warrior of the Southern Water Tribe

Sokka is a warrior from the Southern Water Tribe and the older brother of Katara. Though he lacks bending abilities, Sokka is a brilliant strategist, inventor, and swordsman who proves that you don't need bending to be a hero.

Sokka is known for his humor, sarcasm, and creativity. He often provides comic relief but is also the tactical genius behind many of Team Avatar's successes. He learned swordsmanship from Master Piandao and created his signature sword from a meteorite.

As the self-appointed leader of his village (before joining Team Avatar), Sokka takes his role as protector very seriously, though he initially underestimated the abilities of female warriors like Suki.

Notable quotes:
"My first girlfriend turned into the moon." "That's rough, buddy."
"As a matter of fact, I do plan things. I PLAN things ALL THE TIME!"

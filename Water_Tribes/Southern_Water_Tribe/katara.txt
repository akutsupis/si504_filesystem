Katara - Master Waterbender

Katara is a waterbending master from the Southern Water Tribe and one of Avatar Aang's closest friends and teachers. She is compassionate, determined, and fiercely protective of her loved ones.

As the last waterbender in the Southern Water Tribe, Katara had no formal training until she met Master Pakku at the Northern Water Tribe. Through determination and natural talent, she became one of the most powerful waterbenders in the world.

Katara is also a gifted healer and eventually learned bloodbending (though she despises this technique). She played a crucial role in ending the Hundred Year War and taught Aang waterbending.

Notable quotes:
"I will never, ever turn my back on people who need me!"
"I don't need any protection. I can take care of myself."

Relationships: Sister to Sokka, love interest and later wife of Aang.

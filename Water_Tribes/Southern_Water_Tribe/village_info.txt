Southern Water Tribe

The Southern Water Tribe is located at the South Pole and is the home of Katara and Sokka. During the Hundred Year War, the Fire Nation repeatedly attacked the Southern Water Tribe, capturing all of its waterbenders except for Katara.

By the time of Avatar Aang's awakening, the Southern Water Tribe had been reduced to a small village of mostly women, children, and elderly, as the men had left to fight in the war.

Despite these hardships, the Southern Water Tribe maintained its culture and traditions. After the war ended, efforts were made to rebuild and reunite with the Northern Water Tribe.

The Southern Water Tribe is known for its resilience and close-knit community bonds. Their warrior culture values bravery, sacrifice, and protecting those who cannot protect themselves.

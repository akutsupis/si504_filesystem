The Water Tribes

The Water Tribes are one of the original four nations and are located at the North and South Poles. They are home to most waterbenders and are known for their close connection to the ocean and moon spirits.

The Water Tribes are characterized by their strong sense of community, adaptability, and resourcefulness. They live in harmony with their harsh polar environments, using waterbending and ingenuity to survive and thrive.

Water Tribe culture emphasizes family, tradition, and balance. Their fighting style, like water itself, is fluid and adaptable, turning opponents' strength against them.

The Southern and Northern Water Tribes were separated for a century due to the war, developing distinct cultures while maintaining their shared heritage.
